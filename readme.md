## Smart Traffic Ambulance Management System (STAMS)

Every Second counts when it comes to the Life a patient. Keeping that in mind We have created a Smart Traffic Management System For Ambulance.
- This Application does not use any RFID devices to let the traffic signals know that the ambulance is approaching it, instead it uses the gps to get the location of the Ambulance, calculate the distance between the ambulance and the traffic signal and whether there is actual patient or not and informs the traffic signal.
- this Application also provides the information of the nearby hospitals and route to the nearby hospital.

## Note: Replace the API key of google maps and google places for optimal working of this Application.
